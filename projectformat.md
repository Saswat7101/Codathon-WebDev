# Project Format for 7 Days of Web Development
*Dear Participant, congratulations of coming to the last of this coding marathon. We hope that you have learned many things from this marathon. In the last day of this marathon, you have to make a project which will show your learnings from these seven days.*

## On what topic I will be making my project?
> There is no certain topic. You are open to make any kind of website but you have to keep in mind that you have to use the resources of these 7 Days.

## Tech Stacks
> HTML
> 
> CSS
> 
> JavaScript

Your project **MUST** contain these three tech stacks ONLY. You are not allowed to use any other framework/library.

## Timeline
> The development of your projects starts from 10 July, 2021 at 12:00 AM to 11:59 PM of the same day.
> 
> Your development should start from the mentioned time only. Anyone starting the project before the mentioned time will be disqualified.

## Where to submit the project?
> You have to create a GitHub repository for your project and you must host it. (You can check the Day 7 resource where we have mentioned regarding how to host your website).
> 
> Our coordinators will give one Google Form link where you have to submit the details. It will be shared with you at 10 PM on 10th July, 2021.

## What will be the format of the README?
> Make sure to add a `README.md` in your respository so that we can understand about the project.
>
