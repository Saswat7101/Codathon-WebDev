# Day 06
So yesterday we completed covered some parts of JS and today we'll be going through the rest of them.

Arrow functions are one of those things which have helped to make code in javascript compact. Today we will be learning how we can implement them in our code. Apart from this we will also be working with Spread and Rest Operators and will be having a quick look at the Document Object Model(DOM). We will also start with how we can destructure objects and then we will start with Document object manipulations in JS. Also we will be working on the Document object model and will be interacting with the web pages a bit more.

This concludes the Day 06 of our 7 Days of Web Dev. So with this we have completed JS. So with this we have reached the end of our learning phase. Now its time tto implement what we have learned.

Let's get our game face on ... !!!!
