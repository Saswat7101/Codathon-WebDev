# Day 07
For the last 6 days it has been a rigorous learning phase. We almost covered the whole of HTML, CSS nad JS in jst 6 days. We compiled and provided you with top notch resources. Now its time to reap what we have sowed.

As mentioned earlier we have no learning resources for you on this last day. Rather this day will be completely devoted to making a project. We have not handicapped with you any project idea of our own. Rather you have to make a project of your own choice which will reflect your talent, creativity and innovations. You are free to use any kind of frameworks or any other stack if you already know. 



Now it has been a great journey with you guys for the last 7 days. Hope we will continue this further ... ðŸ’›ðŸ‘‹
