# Day 07
For the last 6 days it has been a rigorous learning phase. We almost covered the whole of HTML, CSS nad JS in jst 6 days. We compiled and provided you with top notch resources. Now its time to reap what we have sowed.

As mentioned earlier we have no learning resources for you on this last day. Rather this day will be completely devoted to making a project. We have not handicapped with you any project idea of our own. Rather you have to make a project of your own choice which will reflect your talent, creativity and innovations. You are free to use any kind of frameworks or any other stack if you already know. 

Here are some of the project ideas which you can start working on:-

   - [Top 10 Projects For Beginners To Practice HTML and CSS Skills](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-projects-for-beginners-to-practice-html-and-css-skills/) 
   - [10 Best Web Development Project Ideas For Beginners in 2021](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/10-best-web-development-project-ideas-for-beginners-in-2021/) 

The best project will be sent to the Hack Club HQ and if they find it interesting then they'll help you optimiseit further and also launch the project. 

But even if your project is not adjudged to be the best, if it is unique, then it will get featured in the Hack Club ITER's project section üëç

Now it has been a great journey with you guys for the last 7 days. Hope we will continue this further ... üíõüëã
