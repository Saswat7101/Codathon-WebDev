# Day 01
Welcome to the first day of 7 days of Web-Dev. Today we'll be starting with HTML which is the skeleton of any Web page. 

Before we plunge into the vast and unending world of Web-Dev, let's first see how a web page loads when we search for it and have a roadmap of becoming a successful Web developer.

We will be starting up with the basics of HTML. We will go through the formatting in HTML, working of a link , various tags, and many more. We will be working with tables and lists in HTML. Tables are an essential part of HTML as you can make many different patterns out of it
