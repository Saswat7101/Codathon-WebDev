# Day 03
So yesterday we completed HTML which is the skeleton of any Web Page. But a Web Page rendered only with HTML code looks like the websites from the 1990s. Only having contents, no styling, nothing. It doesn't at all look good in comaprison to todays websites, which are very attractive and well styled. So today we'll learn about CSS which makes our website look stylish and attractive

So before plunging into CSS lets first of all have a brief introduction regarding CSS.
