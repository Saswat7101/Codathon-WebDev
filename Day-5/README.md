# Day 05
In the last 4 days we learnt HTML and CSS. 

HTML is the skeleton of our Web Page. All the contents of our Web Page is written using HTML.

CSS is used to style our Web Page. Using CSS we can style our Web Page howsoever we want. We can make out bare body HTML containing Web Page into stylish and attractive Web Page using CSS.

Now we have created the look and feel of our Website. But what is a website if it is not functional. We can make our Wesite functional using JavaScript. Now lets dive right into it!!!

Today we will be starting with our journey in JavaScript. We will be starting with what browser-side scripting is, what JS is, how we can work with js, and a hello world program in JS. We will see how we can initialize things in Js, data types, some basic arithmetic operations, and a brief about functions. And also we will be working with Arrays, classes, and objects in JavaScript. We will also be seeing how inheritance works in JS.
